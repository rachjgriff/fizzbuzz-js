FizzBuzz in JavaScript

Writing a FizzBuzz program in JavaScript. The rules of FizzBuzz:

* Print the numbers from 1 to 100
* If a number is divisible by 3 print "Fizz" instead
* If a number is divisible by 5 print "Buzz" instead
* If a number is divisible by 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz" instead

We are using a TDD approach to write this code, writing tests in Jasmine.
